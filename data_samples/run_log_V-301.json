Run a diagnostic check on the sensor to confirm the nature of the drift and assess if it's affecting any critical systems.\n2. Perform a general maintenance check as recommended by the service manual to ensure all other systems are functioning within normal parameters, and to identify any potential issues that could be contributing to or exacerbated by the sensor drift.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Risk Assessment\n* **Severity:** Medium",

    "manufacturing_recommendations": "### \ud83c\udfed Design Flaw Analysis\n* **Vulnerability:** The sensor calibration circuit is vulnerable to minor fluctuations in temperature and voltage, which can cause a drift in sensor readings.\n* **Root Cause:** The root cause of the failure is the lack of robust calibration and validation procedures during the sensor manufacturing process, which can lead to minor malfunctions or temporary calibration issues.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Engineering Fix (CAPA)\n* **Hardware Upgrade:** Upgrade the sensor hardware to include a more robust and stable calibration circuit, and consider using higher-quality sensor components to reduce the likelihood of drift.\n* **Sensor Logic:** Implement a software-based cross-validation mechanism between related sensors to detect and correct for minor drifts in real-time, ensuring that the vehicle's systems remain unaffected.\n* **Fail-Safe Mechanism:** Develop and implement a fail-safe mechanism that triggers a warning or notification to the driver if the sensor drift exceeds a certain threshold, allowing for prompt attention and maintenance.\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Validation Plan\n* **Testing:** Conduct a combination of laboratory testing, including temperature and vibration testing, as well as on-road testing to validate the effectiveness of the engineering fix, with a minimum of 1000 hours of testing.\n* **Expected Result:** The expected result of the CAPA plan is to reduce the incidence of minor sensor drifts by 90% and prevent any potential critical failures, ensuring the overall reliability and safety of the Mahindra XUV 3XO.",
