Run a system diagnostics check to isolate and confirm the source of the sensor drift, ensuring it's a software or hardware issue.\n2. Perform a manual check of the vehicle's vital signs, such as oil pressure and engine temperature, to verify if they align with the telematics data, which currently shows oil pressure at 42 psi and engine temperature at 88 C.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Risk Assessment\n* **Severity:** Medium",
