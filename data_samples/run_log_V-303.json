Run a diagnostic test on the vehicle's sensor system to identify the specific sensor causing the drift and to determine if it's a hardware or software issue.\n2. Perform a general maintenance check as recommended by the official service manual guidelines to ensure that all systems are functioning within normal parameters.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Risk Assessment\n* **Severity:** Medium \nThe oil pressure and engine temperature are within normal operating ranges (40 psi and 91 C respectively), which suggests that the vehicle is currently operating safely. However, if left unaddressed, the sensor drift could potentially lead to more significant issues or inaccurate readings, hence the medium severity rating.",

    "manufacturing_recommendations": "### \ud83c\udfed Design Flaw Analysis\n* **Vulnerability:** The telematics system's reliance on a single sensor for critical readings, without adequate redundancy or cross-validation, has created a vulnerability to sensor drift and potential system failure.\n* **Root Cause:** The root cause of the issue is likely a combination of factors, including a minor calibration error or temporary malfunction in one of the vehicle's sensors, potentially exacerbated by a lack of robustness in the sensor design or insufficient testing protocols.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Engineering Fix (CAPA)\n* **Hardware Upgrade:** Upgrade the sensor suite to include redundant sensors for critical readings, such as oil pressure and engine temperature, to provide cross-validation and improve overall system reliability.\n* **Sensor Logic:** Implement advanced sensor fusion algorithms to detect and correct for sensor drift, ensuring that the system can adapt to minor calibration errors or temporary malfunctions.\n* **Fail-Safe Mechanism:** Develop and implement a fail-safe mechanism that triggers an alert or warning to the driver if the sensor drift exceeds a predetermined threshold, allowing for timely maintenance or repair to prevent more significant issues.\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Validation Plan\n* **Testing:** Conduct a thorough validation plan, including:\n\t+ Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation testing for 1000 hours to validate the performance of the upgraded sensor suite and sensor fusion algorithms.\n\t+ Environmental testing to ensure the system functions correctly under various operating conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, vibration).\n\t+ On-vehicle testing to validate the system's performance in real-world driving scenarios.\n* **Expected Result:** The expected outcome of the CAPA plan is a significant reduction in field failure rates due to sensor drift, with a target reduction of at least 90%, and improved overall system reliability and robustness.",
