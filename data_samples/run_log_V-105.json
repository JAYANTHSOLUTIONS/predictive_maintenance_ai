Monitor the truck's performance and telematics data closely for any signs of actual system malfunctions or deviations from normal operating conditions.\n2. Run diagnostic tests on the sensors to identify and potentially recalibrate or replace the source of the minor sensor drift to ensure accurate readings and prevent potential issues.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Risk Assessment\n* **Severity:** Medium",

    "manufacturing_recommendations": "### \ud83c\udfed Design Flaw Analysis\n* **Vulnerability:** The minor sensor drift detected in the EcoCargo Electric truck's system suggests that the vulnerability lies in the current sensor calibration and validation process, which may not be robust enough to prevent or detect minor deviations in sensor readings.\n* **Root Cause:** The root cause of this issue appears to be the lack of redundant sensor validation and potential insufficiencies in the sensor calibration process, which may lead to inaccurate readings and minor system inconsistencies.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Engineering Fix (CAPA)\n* **Hardware Upgrade:** Implement a dual-sensor system for critical parameters (e.g., oil pressure, engine temperature) to provide redundant readings and improve the overall accuracy of the system.\n* **Sensor Logic:** Develop and integrate an advanced sensor fusion algorithm that cross-validates readings from multiple sensors to detect and adapt to minor sensor drifts, ensuring more accurate and reliable data.\n* **Fail-Safe Mechanism:** Implement an automatic system alert and potential shutdown mechanism if the validated sensor readings exceed predetermined safety thresholds (e.g., temperature > 120\u00b0C), to prevent potential damage to the vehicle.\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Validation Plan\n* **Testing:** Conduct a comprehensive testing plan, including:\n\t+ Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation for 1000 hours to validate the dual-sensor system and sensor fusion algorithm.\n\t+ Environmental testing (e.g., temperature, humidity) to ensure the system's reliability under various conditions.\n\t+ On-road testing with a fleet of EcoCargo Electric trucks to gather real-world data and validate the effectiveness of the CAPA plan.\n* **Expected Result:** The implementation of the CAPA plan is expected to reduce the field failure rate due to sensor-related issues by at least 90%, improve the overall reliability of the EcoCargo Electric truck, and enhance customer satisfaction.",
