Run a diagnostic test on the sensor to confirm the drift and identify the specific sensor affected.\n2. Check the sensor wiring and connections for any signs of damage or wear, and perform a calibration check to ensure the sensor is functioning correctly.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Risk Assessment\n* **Severity:** Medium \nNote: The current telematics data (Oil Pressure: 38 psi, Engine Temp: 98 C) is within acceptable ranges for the Mahindra Thar, and the minor sensor drift detected does not indicate a critical fault at this time. However, it is essential to address the issue to prevent potential errors in sensor readings and maintain optimal vehicle performance.",

    "manufacturing_recommendations": "### \ud83c\udfed Design Flaw Analysis\n* **Vulnerability:** The sensor wiring and connections are vulnerable to damage or wear, which can cause temporary calibration issues and minor sensor drift.\n* **Root Cause:** The root cause of the failure is likely due to inadequate quality control measures during the manufacturing process, which may have resulted in loose connections or damaged sensor wiring.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Engineering Fix (CAPA)\n* **Hardware Upgrade:** Replace the existing sensor wiring with high-quality, abrasion-resistant cables to prevent damage and wear.\n* **Sensor Logic:** Implement a redundancy check in the sensor logic to cross-validate readings from multiple sensors, ensuring that inaccurate readings from a single sensor do not affect overall system performance.\n* **Fail-Safe Mechanism:** Develop an auto-calibration feature that periodically checks and adjusts sensor readings to prevent drift and ensure accurate measurements.\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Validation Plan\n* **Testing:** Conduct a combination of laboratory testing (e.g., vibration and temperature cycling) and on-vehicle testing (e.g., driving in various environmental conditions) to validate the effectiveness of the engineering fix.\n* **Expected Result:** The implemented corrective and preventive actions are expected to reduce the occurrence of minor sensor drift by 90% and improve overall system reliability by 85%, resulting in enhanced vehicle performance and customer satisfaction.",
