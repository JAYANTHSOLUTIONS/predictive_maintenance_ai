Run a system diagnostic to verify the sensor readings and identify any specific sensors that are malfunctioning or drifting.\n2. Perform a general maintenance check as recommended by the official service manual guidelines to ensure all systems are within normal parameters and to potentially reset or recalibrate the affected sensors.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Risk Assessment\n* **Severity:** Medium",
