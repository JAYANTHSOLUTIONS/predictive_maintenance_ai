Check the coolant level and condition to ensure it is at the recommended level and not dirty or degraded.\n2. Inspect the radiator and hoses for any signs of leaks or damage, and test the thermostat operation to determine if it is functioning properly.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Risk Assessment\n* **Severity:** Critical",

    "manufacturing_recommendations": "### \ud83c\udfed Design Flaw Analysis\n* **Vulnerability:** The radiator fan's control circuit and the thermostat's temperature sensing element are susceptible to overheating, leading to a failure in regulating the engine's temperature.\n* **Root Cause:** The failure occurred due to a combination of factors, including inadequate cooling system design, insufficient radiator capacity, and a lack of redundancy in the thermostat and radiator fan control systems, which are critical for maintaining optimal engine temperature.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Engineering Fix (CAPA)\n* **Hardware Upgrade:** Replace the existing radiator with a high-efficiency, heavy-duty radiator featuring a larger core size and improved fin design to increase heat dissipation capacity.\n* **Sensor Logic:** Implement a redundant temperature sensing system with cross-validation between multiple temperature sensors (e.g., engine block, cylinder head, and coolant) to ensure accurate temperature readings and prevent false triggers.\n* **Fail-Safe Mechanism:** Integrate an automatic engine shutdown feature that kicks in when the engine temperature exceeds 120\u00b0C, preventing further damage to the engine and its components.\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Validation Plan\n* **Testing:** Conduct a comprehensive testing regimen, including:\n\t+ Bench testing of the new radiator design for heat dissipation efficiency\n\t+ Vehicle testing under various driving conditions (e.g., city, highway, towing) to validate the cooling system's performance\n\t+ Durability testing (e.g., 1000 hours of continuous operation) to ensure the reliability of the new design\n* **Expected Result:** The implementation of the CAPA plan is expected to reduce the field failure rate due to overheating by at least 90%, ensuring the reliable operation of the Mahindra Scorpio Classic's engine and preventing costly repairs and potential safety hazards.",
