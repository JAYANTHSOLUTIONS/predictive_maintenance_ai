    "manufacturing_recommendations": "### \ud83c\udfed Design Flaw Analysis\n* **Vulnerability:** The oil pump and its associated components, such as the oil filter and pressure sensor, are vulnerable to failure due to high stress and potential manufacture defects.\n* **Root Cause:** The root cause of the failure is likely a combination of factors, including a faulty oil pump design, inadequate material selection, and insufficient testing protocols, which may have led to a higher-than-expected failure rate.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Engineering Fix (CAPA)\n* **Hardware Upgrade:** Replace the existing oil pump with a redesigned one featuring a more robust and durable design, utilizing high-quality materials such as brass or stainless steel for the impellers and housing.\n* **Sensor Logic:** Implement an oil pressure sensor cross-validation system, where the engine control unit (ECU) continuously monitors the oil pressure readings from multiple sensors and triggers an alert or engine shutdown if a discrepancy is detected.\n* **Fail-Safe Mechanism:** Develop and integrate an automatic engine shutdown mechanism that activates when the oil pressure falls below a predetermined threshold (e.g., 5 psi) or when the engine temperature exceeds a critical limit (e.g., 120\u00b0C), preventing further damage.\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Validation Plan\n* **Testing:** Conduct a comprehensive testing protocol, including:\n\t+ Bench testing of the redesigned oil pump for 1000 hours under various operating conditions.\n\t+ Vehicle testing for 500 hours, simulating real-world driving scenarios.\n\t+ Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation for 2000 hours to validate the sensor logic and fail-safe mechanism.\n* **Expected Result:** The engineering fix is expected to reduce the field failure rate of the oil pump and related components by at least 90%, ensuring the reliability and durability of the Mahindra Scorpio Classic engine.",
