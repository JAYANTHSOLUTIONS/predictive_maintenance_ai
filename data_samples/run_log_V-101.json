    "manufacturing_recommendations": "### \ud83c\udfed Design Flaw Analysis\n* **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability in the design of the Mahindra Scorpio Classic is the engine cooling system's inability to effectively cool the engine under certain operating conditions, specifically the radiator's design and the thermostat's calibration.\n* **Root Cause:** The root cause of the failure is the inadequate design of the radiator and the thermostat, which may not be able to handle the engine's heat load under extreme conditions, potentially due to a lack of redundancy in the cooling system or the use of inadequate materials.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Engineering Fix (CAPA)\n* **Hardware Upgrade:** Replace the existing radiator with a high-performance radiator that has an increased surface area and improved coolant flow, and upgrade the thermostat to a more advanced model that can accurately regulate the engine temperature.\n* **Sensor Logic:** Implement a cross-validation system between the engine temperature sensor and the coolant temperature sensor to provide more accurate temperature readings and prevent false alarms.\n* **Fail-Safe Mechanism:** Implement an auto-shutdown mechanism that will shut down the engine if the temperature exceeds 120\u00b0C, to prevent damage to the engine and its components.\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Validation Plan\n* **Testing:** Conduct a combination of laboratory testing, including thermal shock testing and durability testing, as well as on-road testing under various operating conditions, including high-temperature and high-load conditions, to validate the effectiveness of the engineering fix.\n* **Expected Result:** The expected result of the engineering fix is to reduce the occurrence of engine overheating conditions by at least 90%, and to eliminate the risk of engine damage due to overheating, thereby improving the overall reliability and durability of the Mahindra Scorpio Classic.",
