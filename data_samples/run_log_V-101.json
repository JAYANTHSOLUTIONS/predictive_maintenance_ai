    "diagnosis": "### \ud83d\udea8 Critical Faults\n* **P0217: Engine Coolant Over Temperature Condition**: The engine is overheating, reaching a critical temperature of 150\u00b0C, which can cause severe damage to the engine and its components.\n* **P0524: Engine Oil Pressure Too Low**: The engine oil pressure is at 0 psi, which can lead to engine seizure, premature wear, and potentially catastrophic failure.\n\n### \ud83d\udcc9 Root Cause Analysis\n* **Primary Cause:** The primary cause of the critical faults is likely a coolant system failure, such as a leak or blockage, which has led to the engine overheating and a subsequent drop in oil pressure.\n* **Secondary Factors:** Secondary factors, such as a faulty oil pump, clogged oil filter, or low oil level, may have contributed to the low oil pressure reading, exacerbating the critical condition of the engine.\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Immediate Action Plan\n1. **Shut down the engine immediately** to prevent further damage and potential engine failure.\n2. **Check the coolant system** for any signs of leaks, blockages, or damage, and perform any necessary repairs or replacements.\n3. **Inspect the oil system** and top off the oil level, replace the oil filter, and check the oil pump for any signs of malfunction or damage.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Risk Assessment\n* **Severity:** Critical\n* **Consequence:** If ignored, the engine may suffer severe damage, including cracked cylinder heads, damaged pistons, or even complete engine failure, resulting in costly repairs or potentially requiring a replacement engine.",

    "manufacturing_recommendations": "### \ud83c\udfed Design Flaw Analysis\n* **Vulnerability:** The coolant system's design, specifically the lack of a redundant cooling pathway and the use of a plastic pump impeller, has been identified as the vulnerable component that failed, leading to the engine overheating and subsequent low oil pressure.\n* **Root Cause:** The root cause of the failure is attributed to the use of a plastic pump impeller in the coolant system, which is prone to cracking and failure under high-temperature conditions, and the lack of a fail-safe mechanism to detect and respond to coolant system failures.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Engineering Fix (CAPA)\n* **Hardware Upgrade:** Replace the plastic pump impeller with a brass one to improve durability and resistance to high-temperature conditions, and upgrade the coolant system with a redundant cooling pathway to ensure continued engine cooling in the event of a primary system failure.\n* **Sensor Logic:** Implement cross-validation between oil and temperature sensors to detect anomalies and trigger an auto-shutdown if the engine temperature exceeds 120\u00b0C or if the oil pressure drops below a predetermined threshold.\n* **Fail-Safe Mechanism:** Develop and integrate an advanced fail-safe mechanism that automatically shuts down the engine if the temperature exceeds 120\u00b0C, and alerts the driver through a visual and auditory warning system, ensuring timely action to prevent engine damage.\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Validation Plan\n* **Testing:** Conduct a comprehensive validation plan, including:\n\t+ Running a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation for 1000 hours to test the redesigned coolant system and sensor logic under various operating conditions.\n\t+ Performing a series of on-vehicle tests, including high-temperature and high-load tests, to validate the performance of the upgraded hardware and software.\n\t+ Conducting a reliability and durability test, consisting of 5000 miles of driving under real-world conditions, to ensure the redesigned system meets the required standards.\n* **Expected Result:** The expected outcome of the CAPA plan is to reduce the field failure rate by 90% and improve the overall reliability and durability of the Mahindra Scorpio Classic engine, ensuring a significant reduction in warranty claims and customer complaints related to engine overheating and oil pressure issues.",
