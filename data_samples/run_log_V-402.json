Run a diagnostic test on the sensor to confirm the issue and determine if it's a hardware or software problem.\n2. Perform a general maintenance check as recommended by the service manual to ensure all systems are functioning properly and to identify any potential issues that may be contributing to the sensor drift.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Risk Assessment\n* **Severity:** Medium",
