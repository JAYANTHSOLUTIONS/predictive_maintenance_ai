Monitor the truck's performance and sensor readings closely for any signs of worsening conditions, especially focusing on the engine temperature and oil pressure.\n2. Schedule a routine maintenance check to inspect and calibrate the sensors as necessary, and to check the coolant level, engine oil level, and ensure there are no leaks or blockages in the cooling system that could be contributing to the elevated engine temperature.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Risk Assessment\n* **Severity:** Medium \nNote: Although the current issues (minor sensor drift, slightly elevated engine temperature) do not indicate a critical fault, the potential for these issues to escalate into more serious problems (like overheating or oil pressure loss) necessitates prompt attention and monitoring.",

    "manufacturing_recommendations": "### \ud83c\udfed Design Flaw Analysis\n* **Vulnerability:** The sensor calibration and validation process appears to be inadequate, as minor sensor drift was not detected and addressed promptly. Additionally, the cooling system's design may not be optimal, as evidenced by the slightly elevated engine temperature.\n* **Root Cause:** The minor sensor drift likely occurred due to a combination of factors, including inadequate sensor calibration, lack of redundancy in sensor measurements, and potential issues with the cooling system's design or maintenance.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Engineering Fix (CAPA)\n* **Hardware Upgrade:** Replace the existing sensors with more accurate and reliable units, and add redundant sensors to provide cross-validation of critical measurements, such as engine temperature and oil pressure.\n* **Sensor Logic:** Implement advanced sensor fusion algorithms to detect and compensate for minor sensor drift, and add real-time monitoring and alerts for anomalous sensor readings.\n* **Fail-Safe Mechanism:** Implement an automatic shutdown mechanism if critical parameters, such as engine temperature or oil pressure, exceed predetermined limits (e.g., Temp > 120\u00b0C or Oil Pressure < 10 psi).\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Validation Plan\n* **Testing:** Conduct a combination of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations, bench testing, and field testing to validate the effectiveness of the proposed engineering fixes, including:\n\t+ HIL simulation for 1000 hours to validate sensor performance and fault detection algorithms.\n\t+ Bench testing to validate hardware upgrades and sensor calibration.\n\t+ Field testing with a fleet of FreightLiner Pro trucks to validate overall system performance and reliability.\n* **Expected Result:** Reduce the field failure rate due to sensor-related issues by 90%, and minimize the risk of critical faults due to elevated engine temperature or oil pressure loss.",
