Run a system diagnostic to isolate and confirm the source of the sensor drift, ensuring it's not a symptom of a larger issue.\n2. Check the vehicle's maintenance records to determine if any recent repairs or replacements could be contributing to the sensor drift, and schedule a general maintenance check as recommended by the service manual.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Risk Assessment\n* **Severity:** Medium",

    "manufacturing_recommendations": "### \ud83c\udfed Design Flaw Analysis\n* **Vulnerability:** The sensor system's calibration protocol and potentially the sensor itself are vulnerable to minor drifts, which could lead to inaccuracies in vehicle performance monitoring.\n* **Root Cause:** The root cause of the minor sensor drift is likely attributed to a lack of robust calibration routines or insufficient redundancy in the sensor system, possibly compounded by the use of sensors that are sensitive to environmental or operational conditions without adequate compensation mechanisms.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Engineering Fix (CAPA)\n* **Hardware Upgrade:** Implementing sensors with enhanced stability and resistance to environmental factors, such as temperature and vibration, to minimize drift. Additionally, consider integrating redundant sensors to cross-validate readings.\n* **Sensor Logic:** Enhance the sensor logic to include advanced calibration algorithms that can detect and adjust for minor drifts in real-time, as well as implement a cross-validation mechanism between related sensors to ensure data consistency.\n* **Fail-Safe Mechanism:** Develop and integrate a fail-safe mechanism that alerts the driver and potentially adjusts vehicle operation if sensor drift exceeds a predefined threshold, ensuring safety and preventing potential damage to the vehicle.\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Validation Plan\n* **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing, including environmental chamber tests to simulate extreme conditions, road tests under various driving conditions, and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulations for an extended period (e.g., 1000 hours) to validate the effectiveness and reliability of the enhanced sensor system and calibration logic.\n* **Expected Result:** The expected outcome of the CAPA plan is to reduce the incidence of sensor drift-related issues by at least 90%, thereby improving the overall reliability of the Honda City Hybrid eHEV and enhancing customer satisfaction and safety.",
