Run a diagnostic test on the vehicle's sensor system to identify the specific sensor causing the drift and assess its impact on vehicle performance.\n2. Perform a general maintenance check as recommended by the service manual to ensure all systems are functioning correctly and to rule out any other potential issues.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Risk Assessment\n* **Severity:** Medium",
