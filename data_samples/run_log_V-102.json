Check the engine oil level and condition to ensure it is at the recommended level and in good condition, as low oil pressure can be caused by low oil levels.\n2. Inspect the oil pump for wear or damage, and test the oil pressure with a gauge to confirm the reading, as the current oil pressure reading of 8.0 psi may indicate a potential issue.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Risk Assessment\n* **Severity:** Medium\nThe situation does not appear to be critical at the moment, given the engine temperature is 122 C, which is not excessively high, and the oil pressure, although slightly low, does not indicate an immediate failure. However, it is crucial to address the issue to prevent potential engine damage.",

    "manufacturing_recommendations": "### \ud83c\udfed Design Flaw Analysis\n* **Vulnerability:** The oil pressure sensor and its associated circuitry are vulnerable to minor sensor drift, which can lead to inaccurate readings and potentially cause issues with the engine's operation.\n* **Root Cause:** The root cause of the issue is likely due to the lack of redundancy in the sensor system and the use of a low-cost sensor that is prone to drift over time.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Engineering Fix (CAPA)\n* **Hardware Upgrade:** Replace the existing oil pressure sensor with a high-precision sensor that has a built-in temperature compensation mechanism to reduce drift and improve accuracy.\n* **Sensor Logic:** Implement a cross-validation mechanism between the oil pressure and temperature sensors to detect and correct for any discrepancies in the readings.\n* **Fail-Safe Mechanism:** Implement an auto-shutdown mechanism that will shut down the engine if the oil pressure falls below a critical threshold (e.g., 5.0 psi) or if the engine temperature exceeds 125\u00b0C.\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Validation Plan\n* **Testing:** Run a combination of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation and physical testing for 1000 hours to validate the effectiveness of the new sensor and the cross-validation mechanism.\n* **Expected Result:** Reduce the field failure rate due to oil pressure sensor drift by 90% and ensure that the engine operates within safe parameters to prevent damage.",
