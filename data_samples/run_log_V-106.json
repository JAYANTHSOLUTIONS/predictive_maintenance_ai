Check the sensor calibration and perform a reset if necessary to ensure accurate readings.\n2. Monitor the oil pressure and engine temperature closely for any signs of abnormal behavior, and perform a visual inspection of the engine and cooling system to identify any potential issues.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Risk Assessment\n* **Severity:** Medium",
