Run a diagnostic scan to identify the specific sensor causing the drift and verify the issue.\n2. Perform a general maintenance check as recommended by the official service manual guidelines to ensure all systems are functioning properly.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Risk Assessment\n* **Severity:** Medium \nNote: The vehicle's oil pressure (35 psi) and engine temperature (85 C) are within acceptable ranges, and the issue is currently simulated as a minor sensor drift, which does not immediately indicate a critical fault. However, it's essential to address the issue to prevent potential future problems.",
