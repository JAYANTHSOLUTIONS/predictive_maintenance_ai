Run a system diagnostics check to verify the accuracy of the sensor readings and to identify any other potential issues.\n2. Perform a general maintenance check as recommended by the service manual to ensure all systems are functioning within normal parameters.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Risk Assessment\n* **Severity:** Medium",
